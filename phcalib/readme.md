# Analog pH Sensor Calibration

This repository contains information and code for calibrating an analog pH sensor for accurate pH measurement in various applications.

## Overview

Analog pH sensors are commonly used in projects where pH levels of a solution need to be measured and monitored. Calibration of these sensors is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable pH readings. This guide explains the process of calibrating an analog pH sensor and provides example code to get started.

## Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- Analog pH sensor
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- pH calibration solutions (pH 4, pH 7, and optionally pH 10)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (if using)
- Arduino IDE (if using Arduino)

## Calibration Process

### Step 1: Wiring the Sensor

Connect the analog pH sensor to your microcontroller according to the sensor's datasheet. Typically, this involves connecting power (VCC and GND) and the analog output pin to an analog input pin on your microcontroller.

### Step 2: Uploading Calibration Code

Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`calibrate_ph_sensor.ino`) to your microcontroller. This sketch reads the analog output of the pH sensor and calibrates it using the pH calibration solutions.

### Step 3: Calibration Setup

- Immerse the pH sensor in the pH 7 calibration solution.
- Wait for the readings to stabilize.
- Record the analog output value.
- Repeat with pH 4 and optionally pH 10 calibration solutions.
- tune the pots on the sensor to get the ph of the sensor on the serial monitor

## Usage



- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous pH monitoring with alerts or logging based on pH values measured.
